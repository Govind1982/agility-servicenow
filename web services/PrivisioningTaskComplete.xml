            and another to provision Cell Nodes.
            
            So, we are getting two callbacks back.
            As part of our handshake when invoking WAS Deployment Manager and WAS Nodes
            blueprints, we mark them with WAS_DMGR and WAS_Nodes.
            
            Here we determine which one of the tasks has completed.
